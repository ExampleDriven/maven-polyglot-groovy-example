# maven polyglot groovy example

This is the source code for the presentation

https://prezi.com/vb-gw1g5r4c_/maven-polyglot/

groovy build scripts were initially generated by this command

`mvn io.takari.polyglot:polyglot-translate-plugin:translate -Dinput=pom.xml -Doutput=pom.groovy`

to run an inlined maven plugin run maven-polyglot-submodule like this 

`mvn clean install -Dgenerate-file=true`

## Hacks, workarounds

- Travis is using an older version of maven that does not support polyglot. As a workaround the maven wrapper was used. [Bug #4872](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4872)  
- Parent pom has to be built separately using `mvn install -N` [Bug #37](https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven/issues/37)
